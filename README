= +make_resourceful+
===== Take back control of your Controllers. Make them awesome. Make them resourceful.

REST is a fine pattern for designing controllers,
but it can be pretty repetitive.
Who wants to write out the same actions and copy the same model lookup logic
all over their application?

+make_resourceful+ handles all that automatically.
All you need to do to create a fully-capable RESTful controller
is the following:

  class FoosController < ApplicationController
    make_resourceful do
      actions :all
    end
  end

This creates all the standard actions: +index+, +show+, +new+, +edit+, +create+, and +destroy+.
Check out the the default[link:files/DEFAULTS.html] controller for a detailed example
of what a bare-minimum call to +make_resourceful+ creates.
